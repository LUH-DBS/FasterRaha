# Cluster4Raha
Collection of different cluster algorithms usable for Raha to improve scalability.

To improve the scalability of Raha mulitple cluster algorithms have been implemented. The usage of the cluster algorithms was parallelized. On top it is now possible to eliminate duplicates to decrease runtime. 

It is recommended to use K-Means or hierarchical agglomerative clustering with single-linkage with feature-reduction.
