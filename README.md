# FasterRaha
Collection of different cluster algorithms integrated in Raha to improve scalability.

To improve the scalability of Raha mulitple cluster algorithms have been implemented. The usage of the cluster algorithms was parallelized. On top, it is now possible to eliminate duplicates to decrease runtime. 

# Usage

It is recommended to use k-means or hierarchical agglomerative clustering with single-linkage with feature-reduction.

# Refrences

FasterRaha is based upon and uses code from [Raha](https://github.com/BigDaMa/raha).
